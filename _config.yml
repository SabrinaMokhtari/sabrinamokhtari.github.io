  **CV: [PDF](https://sabrinamokhtari.github.io/files/CV.pdf)**

  My name is Sabrina Mokhtari. I am currently a first-year **Master's** student at **University of Waterloo**, 
  working under the supervision of **Prof.** [**Gautam Kamath**] (http://www.gautamkamath.com/). Previously, 
  I was a **Computer Engineering** student at **Sharif University of Technology**, Where I worked as an undergrad 
  research assistant on improving the robustness of vision transformers under the supervision of **Prof.** [Mohammad Hossein Rohban](http://sharif.ir/~rohban/). 
  Before that, I worked as a **data engineer** at [**Wizeanalytics Startup**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wizeanalytics/?originalSubdomain=ir) under the supervision
  of **Prof.** [**Hamid R. Rabiee**](http://sharif.edu/~rabiee/), where I was part of the **Machine Learning** team and worked on an AI-driven big data processing 
  platform that establishes methods on the data storage layer and distributed big data processing to facilitate predictive analytics. My research interests are 
  computer vision, privacy in machine learning, and robustness.

          Wizeanalytics works on designing an AI-driven big data processing platform that establishes methods on the data storage layer and 
          distributed big data processing to facilitate predictive analytics. I joined [**Wizeanalytics Startup**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wizeanalytics/?originalSubdomain=ir) 
          as an intern and primarily worked on BI systems. During my internship I worked on big data processing systems such as Apache Kafka 
          and enabled our platform to work with and analyze real-time data streaming by connecting the system to Apache Kafka. After my internship, 
          I joined the **Machine Learning** team and helped design and implement a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. To that end, I developed 
          several text processing features such as text spell correction, text normalization, and string obfuscation.

          Intelligent Information Solutions Center works on a website that helps create domestic social networks. It allows companies, academic 
          societies, and other social groups to create custom social networks to serve as alternatives to popular global platforms. I joined the 
          Intelligent Information Solutions Center as a software developer and worked with the software maintenance team, where I helped improve 
          the systemâ€™s functionality by designing new features and upgrading and repairing the software when needed.
